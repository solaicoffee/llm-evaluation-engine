# LLM Evaluation Engine

A production-style Python framework for structured evaluation and benchmarking of large language model (LLM) outputs.

---

## Overview

This repository implements a modular evaluation engine designed to score AI-generated responses using configurable weighted metrics.

The framework supports:

- Criterion-based scoring
- Weighted evaluation models
- Aggregated benchmarking
- Deterministic scoring pipelines
- Extensible evaluation logic

---

## Architecture

evaluation/
- engine.py
- metrics.py
- validators.py

benchmarking/
- runner.py

tests/

The architecture separates scoring logic, metric definitions, and orchestration layers to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Engineering Focus

This project reflects practical experience in:

- Advanced Python backend engineering
- AI model evaluation methodologies
- Systems architecture and modular design
- Production-style code organization
- Reliability and scalability thinking

---

## Philosophy

AI systems must be measurable.  
Reliable systems are built through structured evaluation, reproducibility, and modular architecture.
